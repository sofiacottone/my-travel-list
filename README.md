# WanderList - first React project


My personal travel list built with React.

➡️ Try it [here](https://my-wanderlist.netlify.app/) ⬅️

### Features
- add items to the travel list
- remove items
- check packed items
- clear list
- sort items by input, description, status
- see statistics of the packed items

Elements are stored locally to allow persistence of data in case of refresh.


Project based on an exercise from  Jonas Schmedtmann's Ultimate React Course.
